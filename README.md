### Where does this data come from?

**For our first spills story** in this series ([Wastewater Spills In North Dakota: What The Data Tell Us](http://insideenergy.org/2015/01/30/wastewater-spills-in-north-dakota-what-the-data-tell-us/)), the sources of our data are the [New York Times Spills Database](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/23/us/north-dakota-spill-database.html?_r=0) and the [North Dakota Department of Health](http://www.ndhealth.gov/EHS/Spills/). Data also come from [this spills summary spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mdJFAO2J5Slnj4LDvR3dYGDTFD8ajiPH5MImB-6PvRU/pubhtml), provided to us by the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources.

**For our second spills story** ([State Officials Misrepresent North Dakota’s Spill Problem](http://insideenergy.org/2015/02/16/state-officials-misrepresent-north-dakotas-spill-problem/)), we again use data from [the spills summary spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mdJFAO2J5Slnj4LDvR3dYGDTFD8ajiPH5MImB-6PvRU/pubhtml), provided to us by the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources.

**For our third spills story** ([North Dakota Oil and Gas Officials Want Corrections To Our Story. Here’s Our Response.](http://insideenergy.org/2015/02/23/north-dakota-oil-and-gas-officials-want-corrections-to-our-story-heres-our-response/)), we again use the [New York Times Spills Database](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/23/us/north-dakota-spill-database.html?_r=0), the [North Dakota Department of Health](http://www.ndhealth.gov/EHS/Spills/), and [the spills summary spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mdJFAO2J5Slnj4LDvR3dYGDTFD8ajiPH5MImB-6PvRU/pubhtml), provided to us by the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources.

### Data Dictionary

For the total spill count, we used the NYT Spills Database for 2006-October 14, 2014. That includes general incidents as well as 5 spills not in North Dakota's databases. For the remainder of 2014, we used the spill count provided by the North Dakota Department of Health's Oilfield and General Spills that were oil and gas related. 

For `20150223-nd-spills-summary-2004-2013`, the first 10 rows (through Total Wells) are exactly as provided by the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources. Forr the remaining 3 rows, (Spills to Wells Ratio; Year-to-Year Percent Increase, Wells; Year-to-Year Percent Increase, Spills), we used the data provided by the state to calculate spills-to-wells ratio (which we show to be increasing) and the year-to-year percent increase of both wells and spills.
